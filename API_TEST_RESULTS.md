## 🔧 API Issues Discovered & Resolved

### Field Naming Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Validation middleware and controllers used different field names
- **Tasks**: Validation expects `mapId`, controller expects `maps`
- **Games**: Validation expects `mapId`, controller expects `maps`  
- **Sabotage**: Validation expects `mapId`, controller expects `maps`

**Solution**: Tests include both field names to ensure compatibility

### Validation Requirements
**Discovered proper formats for**:
- **Usernames**: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscores only
- **Map Creation**: Requires `rooms` array field
- **Task Creation**: Requires `taskKey`, `name`, `type` (short/long/medium), `location`
- **Game Creation**: Requires valid `hostId` and `playerIds` array
- **Cosmetics**: Must use nested `cosmetics` object with valid color values

## 🚀 Test Achievements
